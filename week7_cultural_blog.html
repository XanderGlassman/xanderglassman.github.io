					<h3>Mitigating Stereotype Threat</h3>
					
					<p>

					Stereotype threat creates a feeling of anxiety that’s hard to overcome with affirmations. Anxiety comes from the reptilian part of the brain, and when “flight” mode is activated, it becomes hard to rationalize feelings. I think that one of the best ways to overcome the feeling is to reassess whatever induced the anxiety in the first place. For example, In my case where I was anxious about seeming too inexperienced and young, I could try and reevaluate why the receptionist was surprised to see me. Maybe she wasn’t expecting anyone to show up because it was a weekend, or maybe she was surprised by what a snappy dresser I am. I think that after attempting to reassess, it could be helpful to try and affirm values and how I actually do fit in. By thinking about how I excel at other things that aren't necessarily related to the value in question, I can maintain my sense of self. </p>
