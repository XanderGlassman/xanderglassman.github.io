					<h3>Printers!</h3>

					<p>Maybe you guys are looking for something a bit more serious, but I feel like inkjet printers are a big problem with the tech industry.
					They foster a bad relationship with technology, and the business practices of many of the companies are quite unethical.  
					They never work as a printer, but if you want bloated with software and features like a terrible copier or scanner, you're in luck!
					The fact that they're never good at their job makes printer company's buisness model even more frusturating.
					They sell a printer at or below cost, and then the ink is literally 8x more expensive than an equal amount of penicillin, and 2 times the cost of human blood!
					It's like a real life version of making a free rollercoster tycoon park and then charging 80 bucks for the bathroom.
					that's why when I grow up, I'm going to buuy a laserjet printer and what a relative joy it will be!
