					<h3>Ruby vs. JavaScript</h3>

					<p>I've gotten about a week of both Javascript and Ruby under my belt, so here are some initial impressions about both of the languages. I started off with Javascript and it was fine, but when I switched to ruby I was impressed by how much easier it is. There's less typing, and more easy to understand English! Ruby also feels like it has more built in features which are really useful. For example, I know about .uinq method, .even?, and looping with each; these guys didn't seem to be in javascript.
					For example, checking to see if something is even in javascript might look like this</p>
					
					<p>function isEven (number){
					if (number % 2 == 0)
						{return true}
					else if (number % 2 !==0) 
						{return false}
					else
						{console.log ("error with isEven")}
					}</p>

					<p>While Ruby looks like this</p>
					
					<p>number.even?</p>
					
					<p>That being said, I get the impression that Javascript might be a bit more universally compatible. </p>
