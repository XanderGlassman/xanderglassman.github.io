					<h3>Exercise 1:</h3>

					<p>When you think of the times in your life where youâ€™ve been the happiest, the proudest, or the most satisfied, which of the following values come to mind?</p>

					<p> Accomplishment Affection Ambition Autonomy Creativity Credibility  Excellence Friendships Helping other people Helping society Insight </p>
					
					<h3>Exercise 2:</h3>

					</p>Pick one value and write a couple of sentences about why one of the values you chose is important to you.</p>

					<p>I value creativity because to me it means not putting boundaries around my ideas and being willing to trust my instincts. It's about taking ideas that currently exist, and combining them in ways that ultimately result in something new. As I become more comfortable with coding, I'm excited to see the opportunities it offers for creativity that I wasn't really expecting. </p>

					<h3> Exercise 3 </h3>

					<p> In general, I try to live up to these values:
Disagree 1 ----- 2 ----- 3 ----- 4 ----- 5 Agree</p>

					<p>Accomplishment 4, Affection 4, Ambition 5, Autonomy 3, Creativity 4, Credibility 3, Excellence 4, Friendships 4, Helping other people 3, Helping society 4, Insight 3
