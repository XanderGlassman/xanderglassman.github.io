					<h3>Dog Corp's View on Wikipedia</h3>

					<p>
						Wikipedia does a great job of keeping me entertained as well, although for me, the home page doesn't play a huge role in my relationship with the site. Instead I generally go to Wikipedia to look up a fact or idea, and then I get lost in the links to other articles embedded in what I'm reading. It works nicely because readers are interested in their current article, and by offering the chance to browse related topics, the site offers more content that interests the user.

					<h3>Dog Corp's View on Reddit </h3>

					<p>
						The first couple of times I visited Reddit, I got overwhelmed and left.  The garble of links on center of the front page can really  intimidate new users. If it wasn't for a friend who urged me to keep checking it out it definitely wouldn't make the list. That being said, it's is a favorite website of mine because the link rating system is great at making sure that enjoyable content always floats to the top. It's great at finding appealing content and staving off boredom. I usually feel entertained at first, but over time it evolves into regret over wasted time.

					<h3>Dog Corp's View on YouTube <h3>

					<p>
						I love YouTube because its huge library of content is so readily available through its great recommendation tool. Over time, the site's ability to predict the videos you would like to watch next has become very impressive, and it's a huge reason why it's on this list. The home page is great; it offers videos you might want to watch based on your previous history, what's popular on YouTube, channels you've watched before, etc. while remaining visually appealing. After a video, the site does a great job of recommending related videos, as well as videos it knows you might want to watch based on your tastes.
