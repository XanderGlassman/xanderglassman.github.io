					<h3>Some Thoughts on Pairing</h3>

					<p>I haven't had a lot of pairing sessions, and so far it's been a tad bit awkward at least at first. Once I relax it's easier to for me to think but in the beginning it feels really hard to be useful. I just want to do well and make the other person feel like I know what Iâ€™m doing, but in order to do that I need to step back and tell myself that it's okay to be new. Once that fear fuzz goes away, I can be really quite helpful!</p>

					<p> It's nice to work in a pair because you learn about techniques that you wouldn't necessarily be using otherwise, and it's easy to learn about them because they are being applied to a familiar problem. I also find that I learn best auditorily, so that's another reason to stick with pairing. </p>
					
					<h3>Some thoughts on Feedback</h3>

					<p>I'm honestly a bit caught off-guard by the pair three times requirement, I just didn't even see it :/. Maybe DBC should include it in the Github, along with an easy way to pair up without too much worry. When I wrote  feedback, I felt anxious because I wanted to be helpful, but honestly there wasn't much I could think of to change. When I did think of things that my pair could work on, it was hard to phrase them in a way that was nice enough but also gave a good message. I think these kind of things just take practice though.</p>
