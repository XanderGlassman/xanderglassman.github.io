					<h3>Why is Javascript so Popular?</h3>
					<p>
						Over the past week, I've been learning a lot about Javascript. I've loved the simple English like-syntax and how nicely it plays with Chrome Dev tools. But real developers like Javascript too! This is because Javascript runs on its users' computers and therefore doesn't slow down servers or use up too much bandwidth. It also works with both on the back and front end, so it's useful for developers who want to see the whole picture of what they are building. It is also one of the world's most used languages, so it works well on multiple devices and browsers. This flexibility is what makes Javascript a relevant and essential coding language for new developers to learn.
