					<h3>The Challenge so Far...</h3>

					<p>So far I would say that my biggest struggle in DBC has been being social and engaging with others online. I get worried in social situations especially when I know that the person is going to be important in my life but I’ve never really met him or her before. I feel like working in groups in person is going to help a lot, but I’m going to have to push myself to be social to really get the most out of the DBC experience.The forced pairing is a great way to interact and learn from my peers, but I know that at first it’s going to be quite stressful. I just have to remember that the more I pair, the less painful that experience will become, and the more benifit's I'll see. I learn best auditorily, so interacting and talking with other people should be an even better way to learn. I’m also a pretty abstract random thinker, so interacting with others is very helpful for my type of style.

<!-- Reflection 

	I really liked this challenge, it was fun to see what I could to to really professionalize my website and bring it to the next level. I feel like I have a lot more control of how my div's interact with one another thanks to the research and work i did on relative and absolute positioning. Overall it was pretty neat to actually make a website that I could envision finding on-line, it's making me excited about learning how to bring them to life.-->
