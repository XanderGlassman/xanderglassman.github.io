				<h3>Functional vs. Object-Oriented Programming</h3>

				<p> 
				So...Where to begin? Object Oriented Programming...Functional Programming... These are...Ways of programming? I've at least gathered that much. But, really, this stuff is confusing. At this point, my level of understanding is not so great, but I'll do my best to convey what I've learned. I feel like  Functional Programming relies more on operations, the verbs of coding so-to-speak. On the other hand, OOP is much more dependent upon real world things and the language we use to describe those things. The dynamic nature of objects (nouns versus Functional Programming's verbs) makes OOP better suited for user interactivity.

				<p>
				I was thinking about action-based websites that rely on user interactions, and I came up with blogging sites such as Tumblr or Blogger. By using Object Oriented Programming, you would be able to update and change how and what users can create quickly and efficiently. For example, if smelly gifs came out and you wanted users to be able to post them, you could create a new class, and use many of the same methods you use on videos and pictures. I feel like a good use of Functional Programming might be encrypting information. In that kind of application, the operations acts as the star, determining the inputs and outputs, while the nouns are much less important.
