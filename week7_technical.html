				<h3>SQL Injection</h3>

				<p> SQL is a the classic database language, around long before the internet. However, because of its age, it is susceptible to SQL injection.
					Back in the day, you didn't have to worry about a user dropping some malicious input because you were the only one talking to the database.
					This left over issue means that a user can use dangerous characters like " and ; to end up creating a new command when inputing data into a database. 
					This ultimately leaves all of the information in your database up for grabs, which is no good.
				</p>
				<p>
					To avoid this you can use an escape string, which creates a function which puts a / in front of all the dangerous characters. 
					The / tells the computer that the following character should only be interpreted only as text. 
					This is usually a pretty good way to fix the problem, but there can be small bugs and whatnot. 
					So annother, more standard way to fix it to use prepared statements. 
					These guys basically mark all the user's input as unsafe, telling the computer "Don't do anything beyond putting this stuff into the database, there are no commands here."
