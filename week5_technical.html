				<h3>Classes!</h3>

				<p>
				Classes model the real world; if an object is any thing, its class is a group that describes that thing. 
				So let's say we're talking about my fish, Kevin. He has a color, a species, and a speed, among other attributes.
				Kevin is an object in the fish class and has properties like color, species and speed.    
				</p>

				<p>
				Classes are important because they allow a developer to organize and manage different types of objects. 
				All objects seem to belong to a class, and this is a good thing, as it tells the computer how it should act.
				For example, knowing that two objects are both fixnum will give the + method a different result than if they were strings.
				You can also make your own classes which is important if you want to make some rules about how the computer should treat a new, custom object.
