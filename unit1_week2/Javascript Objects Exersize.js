secretNumber = to 7
password = "just open the door"
allowedIn = false
members = array{"John", "x", "x", "Mary"

codeVerifier must be a Regular Expression
  ^matches begining of input
  $ matches end of input
  [abc]matches charicter set
  \S matches a charicter other than white space
  + matches preceding charicter 1 or more times
  {2} matches preceding charicter 2 or more times

so after much review...

/^[abc]\S+k\S{2}y$/

 I tried to at
// 
// What parts of your strategy worked? What problems did you face?
  I decided to just start with the first variable and work my way down. It worked pretty well but I became anxious when I found something that I couldnâ€™t figure out right away.

What questions did you have while coding? What resources did you find to help you answer them?

I got thrown off for a little while because I didn't understand Regular Expressions. I looked at the Mozilla dev page and then got anxious because it didn't click right away. I spent some time trying other things, and it was only after I calmed down a little and went back to the Mozella page that it clicked.

What concepts are you having trouble with, or did you just figure something out? If so, what?

It took me a little while to get regular expressions and I'm not quite sure how an expression is different than a function but I'm sure I'll figure it out. 

Did you learn any new skills or tricks?

Yep, I learned about regular expressions, solidified my ability to declare variables, and also learned that sometimes it's best to take a few minutes and relax, maybe watch my fish swim around.
How confident are you with each of the learning objectives?
    
    I'm feeling pretty confident now now!

Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy?

I loved the feeling of having the code work after struggling for a bit 

Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?
Overall I feel like it was a good challenge. I found wrestling with the problem for a while a bit tedious :)
