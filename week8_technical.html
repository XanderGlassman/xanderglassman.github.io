				<h3>Cross Site Scripting</h3>

				<p>Cross Site Scripting is kind of like SQLinjection except instead of ) and ;, the dangerous characters in this case are the angle brackets from HTML. If you don't "escape" angle brackets by converting those bracket into something that the browser doesn't see as an indicator of a tag (ie & l t ; [minus the spaces] for &lt; and & g t ; for &gt;), there will be a vulnerability in your site. This is because someone can put script tags into the input and then write whatever javascript they want. Apparently it's a pretty insidious problem, because anywhere a user inputs something there is the potential for that custom javascript to come into play. Some big companies even have bounties for exposing the vulnerabilities, because the other option, almost complete vulnerability, is so much less appealing.</p>
