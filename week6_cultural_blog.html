					<h3>Stereotype Threat</h3>
					
					<p>As a psychology undergrad, I'm really excited by this blog post, as it's one of the few times I get to use my education in real life! I actually worked with a professor who did some research on stereotype threat's effect on lower income individuals. She found that being reminded of socioeconomic status had a direct effect on how well her participants completed a financial decision making test, which I thought was pretty crazy.</p>


					<p>Anyhow, despite studying it a little bit, I never really considered how stereotype threat effects me. I'm very privileged to be an upper middle class white male, so I don't really run into many negative personal experiences. However, I'd say one time I felt something similar was during a job interview. I was reminded about how young (and hence, inexperienced and under-qualified) I was for the job by the receptionist, who was visibly surprised by my age. It definitely peaked my anxiety even more so, and made me unable to respond to questions that I knew the answer to. If such an experience can throw me off, someone who has very little working against me, I can't imagine what it would be like to be stereotyped as a gender, racial, or class minority. I think it's important to make sure that there are as few stereotype triggers in an environment as possible. If someone is constantly being asked to fill out forms and specify their race, income, gender, etc., the likelihood of feeling stereotype effect becomes much greater. Furthermore, a peer or colleague repeatedly making offensive comments or jokes regarding these issues would also increase this likelihood. I would do my best to amend these and similar situations by bringing them to the attention of authority figures and/or stepping in myself in moments when conflicts arise.</p>
