					<h3>DBC Mindset</h3>
					
					<p>I'm sorry I didn't get to see that video sooner, it was really just what I needed.I feel like DBC should move it up in the curriculum a bit for sure to help everyone get the most out of their prep time.</p> 

					<p> Shereef's talk was really moving to me because I get really anxious whenever I see other people's code and so I tend to avoid it. Shereef did a great job of describing how negatively that impacts me and the importance of working with others as a developer. I think that part of it is that I'm coming in with a fixed view of intelligence and I need to figure out how to fix it. It's not just okay to struggle and work hard, to expose your ignorance, it's necessary,  because that's how someone really grows. What really makes someone successful is their attitude and their effort, and if I can just maintain that mantra, I feel like I'll really get a lot out of this experience.</p>
